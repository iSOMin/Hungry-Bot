# Hungry-Bot
Color Recognition Robot

## details<br>
This robot recognize color and show different images by recognized color type.<br>
The images are shown on the 8x8 led matrix, so you can make any images!<br><br>
I got the original code from https://xyzist.com/forums-all/topic/fabricationlabhungrybot/#comment-1146 <br>
As you see, the robot gets candy color by mouth. This is why the robot's name is hungry-bot. <br>
The code above link had some problems so I solved it and upload my code.<br><br>
Have fun with hungry bot!<br>
